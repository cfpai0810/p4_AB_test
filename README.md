# A/B Test
## by Chun-Feng Pai


## Dataset

> This data set contains 294478 data for A/B test. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. The dataset can help understand if the company should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.


## Summary of Findings

> In our analysis, we find no evidence that the new page brings in more individual conversion. Then we also dig into several factors in order to find the integral factors to the conversion. After analyzing the dataset with regression models, we find no factors with statistical significance. Given the time and money we have to invest in the new-page implementation, we believe its better to keep the old page.
